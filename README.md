# Faveo Testing Tools

These tools will help you troubleshoot issues while using Faveo

# These tools are used to run following tests
  1. <strong>Incoming Mails</strong> - Test incoming email setting, if the required ports are open and server settings are configured to read email
  2. <strong>Outgoing Mails</strong> - Test outgoing email setting, if the required ports are open and server settings are configured to send email
  3. <strong>Phpinfo</strong> - To see your server PHP version and which all extensions are enabled

You can also use <a href="https://github.com/ladybirdweb/faveo-probe">Faveo Probe</a> to check if your system requirement meets the criteria to run faveo

<strong>PS:</strong> If any of these test fail, you need to check your server settings. There can be various reasons for these test to fail. Incase you come across an issue and find a solution to it, create a issue on Github and post the solution there, so community can learn from this knowledge
